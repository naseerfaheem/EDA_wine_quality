# EDA_wine_quality

Introduction: 

This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 12 variables and 4898 white wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties
of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
For the sake of analysis, I combined both datasets into one dataset. I created a new variable designating the type of the wine,
whether red or white wine.

The datasets were provided by Udacity under their Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
